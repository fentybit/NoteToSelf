## About

<p>This is my final project of CS50 (<a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0">CS50x through edX</a>), Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. </p>
<p>Note to Self app is a To-Do Tasks application. First time user is required to register, and returning user needs to log in. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Note to Self is for users to be able to log chores along with correspoding level of priorities.</p>

## Build Status and Future Improvement

<p>Note to Self was completed in a week timeframe from implementing JavaScript, Python, SQL and Bootstrap library. Future cycle of product development as follows:</p>

- [x] Edit. User can only create, read and delete. Ideally, we would like edit functionality.
- [x] Quick Find tab. Over the time, the user will have many tasks, and it gets troublesome when the user needs to immediately access a specific task entry. A search bar to quickly type event title and access the journal entry would be useful.
- [x] Current task entry allows priority, title and description attributes. Each entry should have more functionality for the user, such as weather, scheduling, sharing capability, image upload and so on. 
- [x] Create a toggle track for dark mode. ðŸ˜Ž

## Stack

- [x] Flask
- [x] Jinja
- [x] SQL
